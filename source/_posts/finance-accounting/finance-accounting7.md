## M8-4
Computing Book Value (Straight-Line Depreciation)
Calculate the book value of a three-year-old machine that has a cost of \$31,000, an estimated residual value of \$1,000, and an estimated useful life of five years. The company uses straight-line depreciation.

### 解答
- 每年折旧额 = (成本 - 残值) / 使用寿命 = (31,000 - 1,000) / 5 = 30,000 / 5 = 6,000  
- 累计折旧（3年） = 每年折旧额 × 使用年数 = 6,000 × 3 = 18,000  
- 账面价值 = 成本 - 累计折旧 = 31,000 - 18,000 = 13,000  

## M8-5
Calculate the book value of a three-year-old machine that has a cost of \$55,000, an estimated residual value of \$5,000, and an estimated useful life of five years. The company uses double-declining-balance depreciation. Round to the nearest dollar.

### 解答
折旧率 = 2 / 5 = 0.4

第一年折旧 = 0.4 * 55000 = 22000

第一年末账面价值 = 55000 - 22000 = 33000

第二年折旧 = 0.4 * 33000 = 13200

第二年末账面价值 = 33000 - 13200 = 19800

第三年折旧 = 0.4 * 19800 = 7920

第三年末账面价值 = 19800 - 7920 = 11880

账面价值为 \$11,880。

## M8-6
Calculate the book value of a three-year-old machine that has a cost of \$26,000, an estimated residual value of \$1,000, and an estimated useful life of 50,000 machine hours. The company uses units-of-production depreciation and ran the machine 3,200 hours in Year 1; 7,050 hours in Year 2; and 7,500 hours in Year 3.

### 解答
首先，计算折旧基础：成本 \$26,000 - 残值 \$1,000 = \$25,000。

每机器小时折旧率：\$25,000 / 50,000 小时 = \$0.50/小时。

累计折旧：
- 第1年：3,200 小时 × \$0.50 = \$1,600
- 第2年：7,050 小时 × \$0.50 = \$3,525
- 第3年：7,500 小时 × \$0.50 = \$3,750
累计折旧总额：\$1,600 + \$3,525 + \$3,750 = \$8,875

账面价值 = 成本 \$26,000 - 累计折旧 \$8,875 = \$17,125
## M8-7
Identifying Asset Impairment

For each of the following scenarios, indicate whether an asset has been impaired (Y for yes and N for no) and, if so, the amount of loss that should be recorded.

### 解答
| Asset               | Book Value | Estimated Future Cash Flows | Fair Value | Is Asset Impaired? | Amount of Loss |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| a. Machine          | \$15,500   | \$10,000                    | \$9,500    | Y                  | \$6,000        |
| b. Copyright        | \$31,000   | \$41,000                    | \$37,900   | N                  | \$0            |
| c. Factory building | \$58,000   | \$29,000                    | \$27,000   | Y                  | \$31,000       |
| d. Building         | \$227,000  | \$227,000                   | \$200,000  | N                  | \$0            |


## E8-3
Shahia Company bought a building for \$382,000 cash and the land on which it was located for \$107,000 cash. The company paid transfer costs of \$9,000 (\$3,000 for the building and \$6,000 for the land). Renovation costs on the building before it could be used were \$21,000.

Required:

1. Give the journal entry to record the purchase of the property, including all relevant expenditures. Assume that all transactions were for cash and that all purchases occurred at the start of the year.

2. Compute straight-line depreciation at the end of one year, assuming an estimated 10-year useful life and a \$15,000 estimated residual value.

3. What would be the net book value of the property (land and building) at the end of Year 2?

### 解答
#### 1.
建筑物成本：购买价 \$382,000 + 转移成本 \$3,000 + 翻新成本 \$21,000 = \$406,000  
土地成本：购买价 \$107,000 + 转移成本 \$6,000 = \$113,000  
总现金支出：\$382,000 + \$107,000 + \$9,000 + \$21,000 = \$519,000  
日记账分录：  
借：建筑物 \$406,000  
借：土地 \$113,000  
贷：现金 \$519,000  

#### 2.
建筑物成本 \$406,000，残值 \$15,000，使用寿命 10 年  
年折旧额 = (\$406,000 - \$15,000) / 10 = \$391,000 / 10 = \$39,100  
一年后直线折旧额为 \$39,100  

#### 3.
土地不折旧，账面净值始终为 \$113,000  
建筑物：  
第一年折旧 \$39,100，累计折旧 \$39,100，账面净值 \$406,000 - \$39,100 = \$366,900  
第二年折旧 \$39,100，累计折旧 \$78,200，账面净值 \$406,000 - \$78,200 = \$327,800  
财产总账面净值：土地 \$113,000 + 建筑物 \$327,800 = \$440,800


## P8-6

a. On January 1, purchased a patent for \$28,000 cash (estimated useful life, seven years).  
b. On January 1, purchased another business for \$164,000 cash, including \$10,000 for goodwill. The assets included accounts receivable with a fair value of \$12,000 and property and equipment with a fair value of \$142,000 (with residual value of \$15,000 and estimated useful life of 10 years). The company assumed no liabilities. Goodwill has an indefinite life.  
c. On December 31, constructed a storage shed on land leased from D. Heald. The cost of the shed was \$15,600. The company uses the straight-line amortization method.

e. On December 31 of the current year, sold Machine A for \$6,000 cash. Original cost was \$25,000; accumulated depreciation to December 31 of the prior year was \$16,000 (on a straight-line basis with a \$5,000 residual value and five-year useful life).  
f. On December 31 of the current year, paid \$5,000 for a complete reconditioning of Machine B acquired on January 1 of the prior year. Original cost, \$31,000; accumulated depreciation to December 31 of the prior year was \$1,600 (on a straight-line basis with a \$7,000 residual value and 15-year useful life).  
Required:  
1. Record journal entries for transactions (a) through (f).  
2. For each of the assets involved in transactions (a) through (f), record the adjusting entry for depreciation or amortization expense at the end of the current year. If no adjusting entry is needed, explain why.
