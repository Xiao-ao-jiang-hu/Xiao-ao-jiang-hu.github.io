## About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, and I will begin my master's studies at Tsinghua's Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace in September 2026.

My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning, quantum communication, quantum computing, and network communication theory. Academically, I am also deeply interested in mathematics and theoretical computer science. Beyond research, I enjoy music theory, gaming, computer architecture, and building custom PCs.
